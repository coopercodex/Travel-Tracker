## Introduction
  The goal of this project was to learn how to implement information from an API!  This was a challenging project and i learned alot from this! How to make fetch calls to use data from an API i feel is very important in the world of tech and so i tried to do so here.  I furthed my knowledge on writing and testing the functionality of classes which is also key in the world of computer programming.


## Technologies
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Mocha/Chai
- Webpack
- Fetch API
- Dayjs


## Features
  This application alows a user to login and see their past, pending and upcoming trips!  They can also choose do a mock book a trip which logs their total cost for the trip as well as flight cost and lodging cost.


## Possible Future Extensions
  Future extensions would include logging a saved trip and working on the UI/UX design of the overall project.  I would also like to show pictures of the users trips that have already been taken as well as future ones.

## Setup
  After one person has gone through the steps of cloning down this repo and editing the remote, everyone should clone down the repo.

  Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

  To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with the Turing logo image and a beautiful gradient background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
